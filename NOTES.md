# Architecture

Implements a `CustomTextEditor` for markdown (.md) files.

Our `CustomTextEditor` implementation (called `MarkdownEditorProvider`) is defined in `markdownEditor.js` and registers a webview to show the user when that editor is active

Communication between the webview and VS Code is done using `vscode.postMessage` and is described [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors#custom-text-editor)

The method `getHtmlForWebview` defines what this webview looks like, in our case importing and rendering a custom CKEditor5 build for markdown from the folder `ckeditor5-build-markdown`. It then runs `markdownEditorInitScript` inside the webview to register.
