# About

This extension provides a custom text editor for viewing and editing Markdown (`.md`) files in VS Code.

It is built using the [CKEditor5 markdown plugin](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/markdown.html) for GitHub Flavored Markdown.Â 

_Warning - Although all standard markdown features are supported, be aware that any advanced or customized content not supported by CKEditor5 will be removed from your file when saved including list styles, table styles or page break markers._ 

# Attributions

*   This project would not be possible without [CKEditor5](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5) as a core dependency providing WYSIWYG editor functionality.
